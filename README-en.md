  - Defaultly contains `#leaves`

## Trivia
Because when the author is playing, he found that using in 1.21 the only vein mining mod _FTB Ultimine_ and the only fast leaf decay mod _Accelerated Decay_ in the same time often triggers vein mining leaves and then consumes durability of axe and food rapidly, so he made one own fast leaf decay mod.
